<h1 class="title">lily58 build experience</h1>

<h2> context </h2>
the lily58 keyboard was the first keyboard that ive ever built, and it was my first time soldering. 
i chose the lily58 because it was just so different to other keyboards i looked at, it was a very reasonable size, looked neat to build, and it was an ortholinear keyboard. 
ortholinear is when the keys are aligned in a straight line, which is useful for minimizing movement of the fingers, making the keyboast a lot more 'efficient' depending on the user itself.
however, the main draw for me was the split aspect of the keyboard, which is amazing. the keyboard is split in half, so you can move the two halves anywhere you want depending on what's most comfortable for you. sure there's a learning curve, but i think once that curve is passed the keyboard is a joy to type on.
