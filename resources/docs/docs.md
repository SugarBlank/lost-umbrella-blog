<h3>about me</h3>

hi, i go by the name `scouri` and `sugarblank` online and this is my personal blog for writing about whatever stuff i feel like writing about. a little about me, about what i like, and info about my hardware, etc

im a 16 year old computer enthusiast. im interested in a wide arrange of subjects, ranging from computers/software, skateboarding, anime, learning about mysterious topics/situations, and music. i tend to work a lot, and in my freetime i work on personal coding projects, play the violin, watch anime, read, or hang out with my bearded dragon named rudy. im a pretty lazy and chill person in general, i generally wear pajama pants and oversized hoodies in public. im not concerned about what other people think of me, i tend to just mind my own business and listen to music. i like learning a lot of new things, and when i find something that i enjoy, i think i put in a good amount of effort in understanding said topic. i code primarily in c#, python, java, and ive been meaning to learn clojure. 

as for my hardware, i have a lot of pretty nice things. i have a 10 year old laptop running gentoo linux that i use as a file server, a raspberry pi 4 running as a debian webserver, and an opensuse tumbleweed acer nitro laptop. my laptop has a few modifications to it. ive added an extra 8gb of ddr4 ram to have 16gb of ram in total, it has a gtx 1650, 1tb hdd storage + 256gb ssd storage, along with a external 1tb ssd drive, and a ryzen 5 4600.
