Goal:
Depending on the tags for a post, put it in a page that lists all the posts for a certain category
(eg. Programming posts will go in the programming index)
How to do it?
Pages function returns a map with all the metadata associated with the key value (key value is the
location of the file relative to the resources directory)

Create a function that checks whether or not a post in the resources directory has the specified
category
(Will take the parameters [dir topic metadata(pages function)]
then it will return a list of all the keys that have the specified category
How will I do this?
something along the lines of

(filter #(= (:tags %) topic) metadata)
